                mightiest heroes and heroines found themselves united against a
                common threat. On that day, the Avengers were born--to fight the
                foes no single superhero could withstand! Through the years,
                their roster has prospered, changing many times, but their glory
                has never been denied! Heed the call, then--for now, the Avengers
                Assemble!

                BURNING BLUE FLAMES. A smoky cube shape emerges - THE TESSERACT.
                Filling the screen with BLACKNESS.

            <p>Out in the NEW MEXICO desert, a remote research facility is in a
                state of panic. It's an evacuation. A SWOOPING helicopter flies
                in.

                CHAOS. Men in suits run around like in the typical `we have to
                leave' fashion. Soldiers on foot jump onto Humvees, accelerating
                the hell out of there. A VOICE bellows from hidden loudspeakers.</p>
